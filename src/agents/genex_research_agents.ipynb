    "# Genex Research Agents — Multi-Model Therapy Research + Final Parent Summary (ADK Notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this notebook is\n",
    "This notebook is a **Genex “research agent” prototype** built with **Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)**. It answers parent questions (e.g., “What therapies help?”) by running a **multi-model research pass** (Gemini + GPT + Claude, when keys are available) and then producing **one merged, parent-friendly final summary**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Core idea:\n",
    "- **Profile → Parallel research → Aggregation**\n",
    "- The child’s profile is stored in session state once, then reused across follow-up questions in the same session.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is educational/supportive content and **not medical advice**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs (what you must provide)\n",
    "### 1) API keys (environment variables / `.env`)\n",
    "The notebook initializes clients for:\n",
    "- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (Gemini via `google.genai` / ADK Gemini wrapper)\n",
    "- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (GPT via `openai`)\n",
    "- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (Claude via `anthropic`)\n",
    "It loads keys via `python-dotenv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Parent prompts (runtime)\n",
    "You interact through:\n",
    "- `await ask(\"My child's name is ... age ... diagnosis ...\")`  → stores profile\n",
    "- `await ask(\"What therapies do you recommend for ...?\")`      → triggers research + summary\n",
    "- `await ask(\"More fine-motor activities?\")`                   → follow-up using saved profile\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What it does (process overview)\n",
    "### A) Child profile memory (stateful)\n",
    "- A **Profile Agent** extracts **name / age / diagnosis** from the parent message.\n",
    "- It calls a `save_child_profile` tool to persist the profile in ADK **session state**.\n",
    "- A `retrieve_child_profile` tool is used by downstream agents/tools to ensure the profile exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B) Parallel research (multi-model)\n",
    "The notebook defines **model-specific research tools** that:\n",
    "1) read the stored profile from session state  \n",
    "2) craft an age- + diagnosis-specific prompt  \n",
    "3) call the corresponding model (GPT / Claude / Gemini)  \n",
    "4) return structured research notes (or an error if profile is missing)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **ParallelAgent** runs these researchers concurrently so you get broad coverage quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C) Aggregation (single final response)\n",
    "An **Aggregator Agent** merges outputs from the parallel researchers into one coherent deliverable:\n",
    "- organized therapy recommendations (often by domain: gross motor, fine motor, speech, OT/PT, routines, etc.)\n",
    "- practical at-home suggestions\n",
    "- safety/disclaimer language\n",
    "- a single “FINAL SUMMARY” returned via the runner state\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs (what you get)\n",
    "### Console output\n",
    "The helper `ask()` runs the ADK `runner.run_debug(...)` and prints:\n",
    "- `FINAL SUMMARY` (the aggregator’s merged answer)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Session state artifacts (in-memory / persistent depending on session service)\n",
    "Within a single `user_id` + `session_id`, the notebook stores:\n",
    "- `child_profile` (name, age, diagnosis)\n",
    "- the aggregator’s `final_summary`\n",
    "- (optionally) intermediate research outputs, depending on how tools write state\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you restart the kernel or change session ids, the profile may be lost unless you’re using a database-backed session service.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to run\n",
    "1) Run cells top-to-bottom to load keys, define tools/agents, and initialize the ADK `Runner`.\n",
    "2) Start with a profile message (required once per session).\n",
    "3) Ask therapy questions; the notebook will reuse the stored profile automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations / known constraints\n",
    "- If the **profile isn’t stored**, research tools return an error asking for name/age/diagnosis first.\n",
    "- Output quality varies by **model availability** and API access.\n",
    "- This notebook is a **prototype research/summarization pipeline**, not a clinical decision system.\n"

    "### Summary of the Genex Research Framework (Current State)\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework is a **stateful, multi-agent, multi-model research system** designed to generate **child-specific developmental guidance** in a structured, extensible, and safe way. It cleanly separates *data collection*, *expert research*, and *synthesis*, making it easy to extend later with milestone tracking, developmental-age estimation, and activity planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Profile Agent — Child Context & Memory\n",
    "**Role:** Establishes and maintains persistent child context across turns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extracts the child’s **name, age, and diagnosis/condition** from user messages.\n",
    "- Stores this information in **session state** (memory), scoped to `(user_id, session_id)`.\n",
    "- Enables all downstream agents to operate on a **consistent, shared child profile**.\n",
    "- Does **not** provide therapy guidance or reasoning — its sole responsibility is identity and memory management.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Output:  \n",
    "> `state[\"user:child:name\"]`, `state[\"user:child:age_years\"]`, `state[\"user:child:diagnosis\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Parallel Research Team — Independent Expert Perspectives\n",
    "**Role:** Gather diverse, independent research perspectives tailored to the child.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `ParallelAgent` runs three specialized researcher agents concurrently:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gemini Researcher**\n",
    "  - Retrieves the stored child profile.\n",
    "  - Delegates content generation to Gemini via a tool.\n",
    "  - Produces structured, age- and diagnosis-specific developmental insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GPT Researcher**\n",
    "  - Uses the same stored child profile.\n",
    "  - Calls GPT via a tool for practical, applied recommendations.\n",
    "  - Returns child-specific research output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Claude Researcher**\n",
    "  - Also retrieves the child profile.\n",
    "  - Delegates reasoning and narrative generation to Claude.\n",
    "  - Emphasizes clarity, tone, and developmental nuance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics:\n",
    "- Researchers **do not communicate with each other**.\n",
    "- No summarization or merging happens at this stage.\n",
    "- Each model’s bias and strengths are preserved intentionally.\n",
    "- All outputs are written to shared state under distinct keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Outputs:  \n",
    "> `state[\"gemini_research\"]`  \n",
    "> `state[\"gpt_research\"]`  \n",
    "> `state[\"claude_research\"]`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Aggregator Agent — Synthesis & Parent-Facing Output\n",
    "**Role:** Convert multi-model research into one coherent, supportive answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Re-retrieves the child profile to ground the final message in context.\n",
    "- Reads all available researcher outputs from state.\n",
    "- Synthesizes them into a **single, structured, parent-friendly summary**.\n",
    "- Enforces a consistent format, tone, and level of detail.\n",
    "- Highlights areas of agreement and notes meaningful differences between models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aggregator is deliberately separated from research so that:\n",
    "- Summarization logic can evolve independently.\n",
    "- Additional research sources can be added later.\n",
    "- Output format remains stable even if models change.\n",

    "- → final_summary (parent-facing response)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why This Architecture Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Personalized:** Every response is tied to a specific child, not a generic condition.\n",
    "- **Robust:** Multiple LLMs reduce single-model bias or failure modes.\n",
    "- **Explainable:** Intermediate research outputs are preserved in state.\n",
    "- **Extensible:** Future pipelines (CDC milestones, developmental age, activity planning) can reuse the same profile memory and aggregation patterns.\n",
    "- **Production-ready:** Clear separation of concerns supports testing, iteration, and scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework forms the **foundational research layer** of Genex, upon which milestone assessment, therapy planning, and long-term progress tracking will be built."
